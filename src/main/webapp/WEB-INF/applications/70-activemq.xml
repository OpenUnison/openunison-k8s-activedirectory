                  * group - The DN of the group in OpenUnison's virtual directory (must be an instance of groupOfUniqueNames)
                  * dn - The base DN of the user or users in OpenUnison's virtual directory
                  * dynamicGroup - The DN of the dynamic group in OpenUnison's virtual directory (must be an instance of groupOfUrls)
                  * custom - An implementation of com.tremolosecurity.proxy.az.CustomAuthorization -->
